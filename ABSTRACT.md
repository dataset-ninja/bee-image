The **Bee Image Object Detection** dataset was generated for the purpose of detecting bee objects within images. The dataset comprises videos captured at the entrances of 25 beehives situated in three separate apiaries in San Jose, Cupertino, and Gilroy, CA, USA. These videos were recorded directly above the landing pads of various beehives. The camera was positioned at a unique angle to capture distinct and clear images of bees engaged in activities such as taking off, landing, or moving around on the landing pad.

The images were saved one frame per second from videos. The annotation platform Label Studio was selected to annotate bees in each image due to the friendly user interface and high quality. The below criterial was followed in the labeling process. First, at least 50% of bee body must be visible. Second, the image cannot be too blurry. After tagging each bee with a rectangle box in the annotation tool, output label files with Yolo labeling format were generated for each image. The output label files contained one bounding-box (BBox) coordinates for each of the bees in the image. If there were multiple objects in the image, there would be one line for one object in the label file. It recorded the object ID, X axis center, Y axis center, BBox width and height with normalized image size from 0 to 1.
